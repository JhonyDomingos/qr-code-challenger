## My process
STEP 01 - Defines the General  HTML/CSS Structure and organize the elements inside the divs.
STEP 02 - Import the image and Configured the background, font-style, font-size and font-family
STEP 03 - Configure the Div using border-radius, defined the width/height, background, border-radius,display flex directions. OBS: For me this was kinda difficult, i've find some help in W3School..
STEP 04 - Configure all the margins, paddings and some details that pass through ( I have some problem with )
STEP 05- Here I had some problems, my layout was breaking as it was decreasing to test liquidity, after racking my brain, i try put all of my layout inside a Div with class container. didnt break anymore
